## Installation Instructions

1. Download the font(s) of your choice
2. Place the font files (.otf or .woff2 format) in the public/fonts/ directory
   - If using .otf files, make sure the CSS includes `format('opentype')`
   - If using .woff2 files, make sure the CSS includes `format('woff2')`
3. The site is already configured to use CommitMono by default, with fallbacks to other fonts

Note: Commit Mono is recommended as it aligns perfectly with the minimal aesthetic of the site and your chosen color scheme (Clay Tones for light mode and Obsidian for dark mode).
